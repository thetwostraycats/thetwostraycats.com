# Two Stray Cats - Our Travel Adventure

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Two Stray Cats**! This repository hosts the source code for our website, **[thetwostraycats.com](https://thetwostraycats.com)**, where we share our travel vlogs, adventures, and connect with our community.

## About Us

We are a travel vlogging couple exploring the world together. Over the past year and a half, we've visited more than 30 countries, capturing our experiences and sharing them on our YouTube channel. Our content includes unique travel insights, tips, and fun moments from our journey around the globe.

## Why This Repository?

Initially, I used this domain for a personal blog that didn't gain much traction. As someone fairly savvy with coding, I decided to repurpose it for something more meaningful and interactive - our travel vlog and community hub! Now, this GitHub repository serves as the backend for our website, allowing us to easily update and maintain our content.
